# Feature Interview Template

Use this template for new feature development - adding meaningful new capabilities.

## Interview Depth
- **Questions**: 20-35
- **Focus phases**: Scope & Solution (3), Technical Design (4), Edge Cases (6)
- **Light phases**: Users (2) if internal, Metrics (8) if no tracking

## Phase Adjustments

### Phase 1: Problem & Context
Standard depth. Ask:
- What triggers the need for this feature?
- What do users currently do instead?
- What's the business value?

### Phase 2: Users & Stakeholders
Standard depth unless internal tool, then condense:
- Who's the primary user?
- What's their skill level?
- Any approval needed?

### Phase 3: Scope & Solution
**Full depth** - critical for features:
- What's the core capability?
- What's v1 vs later?
- What's explicitly out?
- Which approach of multiple options?
- What's the minimum viable version?

### Phase 4: Technical Design
**Full depth**:
- All core questions
- Architecture implications
- API design
- Data model changes

### Phase 5: Constraints
Standard depth:
- Timeline constraints?
- Technical constraints?
- What trade-offs acceptable?

### Phase 6: Edge Cases
**Full depth**:
- Walk through user journey edge cases
- Error scenarios
- Concurrent usage
- Scale concerns

### Phase 7: Testing
Standard depth:
- Key test scenarios
- Automation approach
- Quality gates

### Phase 8: Metrics
Condense if no analytics:
- How to know it worked?
- Key usage metrics?

### Phase 9: Implementation
Standard depth:
- Milestone breakdown
- Dependencies
- Rollout strategy

## Spec Output
Use full specification template with all sections.
