{"id":"sb-b6k","title":"Blitz: Run TTS detection and bead show in parallel","description":"During blitz initialization, TTS detection (invoke tts-status) and bead context loading (bd show) are independent operations that currently run sequentially. They could run in parallel to reduce startup latency.\n\nCurrent flow:\n1. Validate bead ID\n2. Load bead context (bd show) \n3. Auto-detect TTS (invoke tts-status)\n\nProposed flow:\n1. Validate bead ID\n2. In parallel:\n   - Load bead context (bd show)\n   - Auto-detect TTS (invoke tts-status)\n3. Proceed with interview\n\n## Clarifications from Blitz Interview\n\n**Race handling**: No shared state between operations. They are fully independent. The TTS status result will control subsequent behavior (whether to use voice or not).\n\n**Failure mode**: If TTS detection fails/times out while bead loading succeeds:\n- Mention the TTS failure to the user\n- Proceed with text-only interview\n\n**Documentation**: Update SKILL.md blitz initialization section AND add inline code comments explaining the parallel execution pattern.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-04T17:37:46.267254-08:00","created_by":"agrande","updated_at":"2026-01-04T19:30:47.377151-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-04T19:30:47.377151-08:00","close_reason":"Updated SKILL.md and commands/blitz.md to document parallel execution of TTS detection and bead context loading"}
{"id":"sb-db1","title":"Investigate running TTS say/summary-say in background by default","description":"# Investigation Complete: Background TTS Execution\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n**Recommendation**: Modify skill prompts to instruct Claude to use `run_in_background: true` when invoking the Bash tool. This is a plugin-side change requiring no Claude Code modifications.\n\n## Findings\n\n### Mechanism 1: Bash `run_in_background` Parameter ✅ WORKS\n\nThe Bash tool has a `run_in_background` parameter:\n- Runs commands asynchronously, returns task ID immediately\n- Output buffered for retrieval via `TaskOutput` tool\n- **Verified**: TTS ran successfully in background while Claude continued working\n\n### Mechanism 2: Skill Metadata Declaration ❌ NOT SUPPORTED\n\nSkills cannot declare background execution in YAML frontmatter. Only `description` is available; no `background`, `async`, or similar fields exist.\n\n### Mechanism 3: Skill Prompt Instruction ✅ RECOMMENDED\n\nSkill prompts can include instructions for Claude to follow. Modified skill example:\n\n```markdown\n---\ndescription: Speak text directly using TTS (smoke test)\n---\n\nRun this command in the **background** so you can continue working while audio plays:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/say.sh $ARGUMENTS\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**Important**: Use `run_in_background: true` when calling the Bash tool.\n```\n\n### Mechanism 4: Self-Backgrounding Script ⚠️ POSSIBLE BUT NOT RECOMMENDED\n\nScript could use `(command \u0026)` or `nohup`, but:\n- Complicates error handling\n- Loses output feedback to Claude\n- More maintenance burden\n\n## Tradeoff Analysis\n\n| Approach | Reliability | Complexity | Error Handling | Plugin-side |\n|----------|-------------|------------|----------------|-------------|\n| Skill prompt instruction | Medium | Low | Good | ✅ |\n| Self-backgrounding script | High | Medium | Poor | ✅ |\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**Primary approach**: Modify `/say` and `/summary-say` skill prompts to instruct Claude to use `run_in_background: true`.\n\n**Why this is best**:\n1. Uses Claude Code's built-in mechanism\n2. Preserves error handling (output retrievable via TaskOutput)\n3. No script changes required\n4. Purely plugin-side solution\n5. Low complexity\n\n**Generalizing to other skills**: Any skill can adopt this pattern by adding background execution instructions to its prompt markdown. This is a documentation/convention pattern, not a technical limitation.\n\n## Limitations\n\n1. Relies on Claude following prompt instructions (not enforced)\n2. No way to declaratively specify background in skill metadata\n3. Output requires explicit TaskOutput retrieval if needed\n\n## Next Steps\n\nCreate follow-up task to implement the skill prompt changes for `/say` and `/summary-say`.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-04T18:28:59.788949-08:00","created_by":"agrande","updated_at":"2026-01-04T18:59:16.830935-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-04T18:59:16.830935-08:00","close_reason":"Investigation complete.
